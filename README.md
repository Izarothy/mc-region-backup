# Minecraft region backup

Minecraft worlds get pretty big and backing up all of it across multiple versions is painful. This project makes it possible to backup small locations by downloading their 512x512 region files, after setting up FTP and giving it two points of coordinates.

## Env template:

FTP_HOST =</br>
FTP_LOGIN =</br>
FTP_PASSWORD =</br>
